    <h2>Crafting</h2>
    <p > 
        Crafting reduces stress and is a great way to pass the time. 
        Itâ€™s a path to express and showcase talent and creativity using various techniques. 
        This hobby gives me relaxation and helps reduce stress, making me happy. 
        I enjoy crafting with my daughter.

    <h2>Gardening</h2>
    <p "> 
        Gardening is a hobby I truly enjoy because it allows me to connect with nature while 
        nurturing my plants and flowers. It provides me with physical exercise and mental 
        relaxation, and I find great satisfaction in watching life grow from seeds into 
        beautiful blooms.
